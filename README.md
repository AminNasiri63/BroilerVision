## 🐔 BroilerVision
YOLOv8 + DeepSORT Pipeline for Broiler Detection and Tracking

BroilerVision is an end-to-end computer vision pipeline that reads a video, detects broiler chickens using a YOLO-based detector, and tracks them across frames using the DeepSORT multi-object tracking algorithm.

This system is designed for precision livestock farming, enabling automated monitoring of broiler behavior, movement patterns, and interactions in commercial poultry houses.
